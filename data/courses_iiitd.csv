This is a hard 2xx level class. This course is an examination of politics as an activity constitutive of humanness. The course introduces students to foundational problems in political anthropology. Order, sovereignty and contestation, government, State and subject are key categories we will examine. Our first question: can there be order in the absence of a government, state, leader, sovereign? We then examine order in the context of empire and kingship, with case studies from Asia and Europe. Next, we trace the emergence of 'government' as a (modern) project of order in the political history of Europe. We look at how systems of political order are transformed during the period of Colonial rule/governance. We will then see the centrality of bureaucracy to modern governance. The second half of the course opens with inquiries into the central political forms of modern history is the 'nation' and the constitution. If constitution is one side, insurrection is its other side and we examine how both are constitutive of 'democracy'. Taking violence as an analytical object, we study the state (and its apparatuses of subjection) at the margins, treading at the limits of legality. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the political, that is, politics as the distinction between friend and enemy. Another way to look at this course: a survey of forms of power, and the forms of subjection produced in persons subject to power.

Cave paintings, books, cinema, more recently an array of digital mediums; all of which are examples of narratives help to communicate, emotional connect, empthise, or even understand ideas, concerns and concepts. According to anthropologist, Mary C. Bateson, ""the human species thinks in metaphors and learns through stories."" Metaphors help human's to understand abstract concepts. Humans make sense of design through the narrative function of the brain and design uses this connection to create more effectively. Storytelling is a memorable way to communicate ideas with emotional resonance. A story refers to the description provided by a narrative and exhibits a narrative structure and dramatic tension. Narratives are used in design as a technique to get insight into users, build empathy and access them emotionally. With stories, designers speak to increase the appeal of what they offer and provide a solid understanding of the users. For eg., UX designers typically tell on-screen stories, weaving narratives to make users invest their emotions in our messages. Designers aim to engage users through their feelings, as opposed to describing design of the product or system from a functionalist/task-oriented viewpoint. An effective user experience depends on the success of users’ achieving their goals ‘usability-wise’. However, storytelling is the framework used by designers to reach users. The world can be experienced through metaphors, not bullet-point specifications, storytelling is the best way to relate to audiences. Effective storytelling means going beyond getting users emotionally invested, to keeping them engaged after their experiences, too, so they attach more meaning to designed products/services. Sketching/Drawing is used as medium both to form a conceptual understanding and execution of narrative as a tool of communication. Sketching/Drawing in Visual Commuication is a fundamental tool for Narratives, which is not limited to using the analogus pencil on paper or the digital tablet and pen. It is an activity that involves observation, visualisation and storytelling.",4,,,,winter,TBA,[],,52:19.3,52:19.3,"visual-narratives, storytelling, graphic-design, sequential-art, design-semiotics, media-literacy, narrative-structures, user-engagement, illustration, design-research"

The emphasis is on drawing by hand, which is the most direct and intuitive means we have to express our visual thoughts and perceptions. In direct response to our visual thoughts and perceptions, we develop an understanding of spatial concepts and the critical ability to think and visualize in three dimensions through the tactile nature of drawing. VISUALIZATION DRAWING : Visualization is an act of thought or reflection. In design, we speculate and visualize what might be possible in the future. Drawing gives material existence to our conceptions so that they can be seen, assessed, and acted upon. The drawing out of these ideas, whether executed quickly or slowly, roughly or carefully, is necessarily speculative in nature. We can never determine beforehand precisely what the final outcome will be. The developing image on paper gradually takes on a life of its own and guides the exploration of a concept as it travels between mind and paper and back again. Drawing from the imagination addresses issues that arise as we think in a speculative manner to stimulate the design process, develop our design ideas through drawing, and plan how to present our design proposals in the best possible light. This course gives the students an overview of the generative and developmental stages of the design process and drawing as distinctly speculative in nature.

But these are just platforms. Actually, Social media is the vast amount of content we have produced and its consequences for our lives. The content we produce are not just memes and selfies alone, but they are also tools for making and breaking relationships, a means for creating equality and/or reinforcing inequality. While there have been grand claims made about how social media has impacted the lives of people around the world, we often fail to ask is it really likely that social media has changed the life of a low-income builder in Brazil in exactly the same way as it has for an IT professional in South India or that of a factory worker in China? Consider this claim... social media is a sort of big brother that knows all our intimate details and we have lost our rights to privacy. While it is true for some, it is equally true that social media is also the first-time people experience privacy. For e.g. In China, for some people far from being a threat to their privacy, social media was actually the very first time they had experienced what we would call individual privacy. This was true in Turkey as well. Similarly, while it is true that while some might view social media as a distraction to education, it is equally true that for a few others social media is itself education. Likewise, for some the Selfie is more about expressing friendship rather than individual glamour, thus subverting the notion of individualism. How do we know this? Why do people see the same phenomenon differently? While it is important to understand ‘what’ content we produce, the question of why we produce such content is equally significant.

In other words, we want to ask, what are the fundamental limitations that a system and a given task imposes on all possible algorithms that can solve that given task? One possible way to tackle such questions is through the discipline of information theory, and this course is meant as an intorduction to this field. The course will broadly cover three canonical systems: The lossless storage system requiring minimal storage space consumption with perfect recovery, the noisy communication channel requiring maximum communication rates for arbitrarily low probability of decoding error, and the lossy storage system requiring minimal storage space while allowing a pre-defined level of distortion in the recovered data. To tackle these three broad problems, we shall first introduce the fundamental information theoretic quantities such as entropy, relative entropy, mutual information, and study their properties. Next, we shall introduce various tools required for proofs such as asymptotic equipartition property, Fano's inequality, method of types, data processing inequality. Finally, the student will be introduced to the probabilistic method for obtaining proofs. We shall then leverage these proof techniqes to see how the fundamental limits of the above-mentioned systems can be expressed in terms of the quantities such as entropy, relative entropy, and mutual infomation. Individual or groups of students (depending on the number of attendees) will be asked to choose and explore one further topic from a curated list of topics from areas such as network information theory, applications of information theory, information theoretic security, common information.

5383a5fe-4048-4d9f-985f-85d600ec8e6d,SSH300,TE,Theories of Ethics,SSH,"The history of Ethics in the western philosophical tradition has witnessed a fundamental shift in its set of concerns and its basic approach in modernity that marks a ‘decisive break’ in relation to its point of departure in ancient Greek thought. This shift, broadly characterized, consists in moving from the question of what constitutes a ‘good life’—one that is conducive to the fullest realization of human potentiality, to what constitutes ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ action. This course will articulate and analyse the major ethical theories and approaches in the Western tradition in light of this shift. Such a broad historical perspective would allow students to apprehend why for instance, the preoccupation with the ‘Good’ gives rise to ethics of a particular ‘shape’, namely, ‘virtue ethics’; whereas the questions of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, along with the procedural mode of their determination, emerge in the context of Enlightenment modernity, and the ‘disenchantment of nature’ that it brings in its wake. If ethics, under conditions of modernity, is compelled to take a more procedural form, as a reaction to ethical scepticism and the evisceration of ‘ethical content’ that the deracination of God from nature, hence of purposiveness in nature, entails, then the issue of what remains of the ‘old’ in the ‘new’, of the ancient in the modern, also surfaces. These themes would be pursued in different modalities, by raising, for instance, the problematic of the (privileged) ontological status of the ‘human’ (as opposed to the ‘animal’), in the modern discourse on ‘Human rights’ and environmental ethics.",4,,,5,monsoon,Nishad Patnaik,"[{""day"": ""Monday"", ""end_time"": ""11:00"", ""start_time"": ""09:30""}, {""day"": ""Wednesday"", ""end_time"": ""11:00"", ""start_time"": ""09:30""}]",,52:21.9,52:21.9,"ethics, moral-theories, utilitarianism, deontology, virtue-ethics, applied-ethics, philosophical-analysis"

But could this have happened without the Internet? This course offers a 'new' media perspective to answer this puzzle, and combines varied explanations to develop macro- level theoretical insights around contemporary politics and implications for policy and regulation. (In PART I) we begin by questioning the binaries in debates around 'hacktivism' which either ignore the difference between old and new media or adopts a heavy ‘technological determinism’ in their explanations. Instead, we develop arguments around the newness of Internet-enabled political action, covering key and historical and technological development relating to spatial nature of new populism ('counter public sphere' Fraser 1992), social movements (Wellman and Raini 2012) as well as communicative power (Castells 2009). (In PART II) we consider several prominent case studies and examples to evaluate these theoretical and conceptual insights. We begin with the 'occupy' movements that spread across the world after the financial crisis in early 2010s, and then analyse the use of new media in the uprisings in Arab world and Asia. Taking a series of case studies we theorise the power of Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp as 'new' intermediaries and analyse the populist trend in terms of the changing balance between the state and society and the slow erosion of established institutions. These cases focus primarily on populist politics but also include new environmental movements, civic activism and digital journalism.

As the control plane is separated from the switching hardware, it is easier to change its software, thereby speeding up software development cycle and in turn lowering the barrier for innovation.

fb44d854-208a-405e-a89a-d2b8f06d10b3,CSE619,PALG,Parameterized Algorithms,CSE,"It is well known that most of the well-known optimization problems are computationally hard. It means that solving them by using a naive approach may take several years even for moderate sized input instances. Algorithms that run in polynomial-time are usually considered as feasible computation. Parameterized Complexity is an approach that attempts to extends the notion of feasible computation for NP-hard problems. The idea is to introduce a paramter in addition to the input instance for a classical problem. The running time of a algorithm allows exponential blow-up with respect to the paramter but the algorithm runs in polynomial-time otherwise. Another important part to design paramterized algorithms is polynomial-time preprocessing, also known as kernelization. Theory of parameterized preprocessing aims to build a theoretical foundations towards the greedy heuristics. One objective of this course is to understand how the basic algorithm paradigms, e.g. use of divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy methods can be used to design kernelization and fixed-parameter algorithms. Another objective of this course is to understand the theory of computational intractability in the world of paramterized complexity. This objective involves expositions to parameterized complexity classes W[1], W[2] etc. and eventually designing algorithms that reduces one parameterized problem to another parameterized problem in addition to preserving the parameters. This part also involves understanding the differences between classical polynomial-time reductions and parameterized reductions. The third obejctive of this course is to understand how the classical complexity-theoretic ideas relate to the theory of lower bounds for kernelization (paramterized preprocessing).",4,"CSE121, MTH201, CSE222",,5,monsoon,Diptapriyo Majumdar,"[{""day"": ""Tuesday"", ""end_time"": ""16:30"", ""start_time"": ""15:00""}, {""day"": ""Thursday"", ""end_time"": ""16:30"", ""start_time"": ""15:00""}]",,52:14.0,52:14.0,"FPT-algorithms, complexity-theory, kernelization, combinatorial-optimization, graph-theory-applications"
